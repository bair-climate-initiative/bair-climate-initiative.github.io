        <p class="lead fs-lg">Observational, Multimodal, and Multiscale (OMMS) data sources are ubiquitous in scientific fields related to climate change, such as hydrology. These data are difficult to obtain, hard to align, and require bespoke engineering to use in machine learning pipelines. The initial focus of the BAIR Climate Initiative (BCI) is on developing methods, benchmarks, and software frameworks for integrating OMMS data sources with machine learning libraries, thus reducing programming overhead for scientists while improving the AI methods that can be used for these problems.</p>
