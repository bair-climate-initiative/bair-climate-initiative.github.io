  description: To drive research and development for Observational, Multimodal, and Multiscale (OMMS) data sources, the BCI is launching a benchmark paired with an international prize competition focused on the 'Fate of Snow' in partnership with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Meta AI. The Fate of Snow project will aim to model and predict the partitioning of snow over basin-scales in high-altitude complex terrain. By combining a range of remote sensing, in-situ, and simulated data sources, we aim to create a multifaceted benchmark of estimates of observational constraints on the major fluxes of water including evapotranspiration, snow sublimation, infiltration and runoff.

- title: Harmful Algal Bloom Detection

  description: The BCI is working with NASA Earth Science Applied Sciences to design and administer a prize competition that will challenge participants to identifies cyanobacteria blooms in small water bodies (lakes, shorelines) -- a crucial identification task needed by water resource managers to rapidly detect and mitigate harmful algae blooms. This project relies on Observational, Multimodal, and Multiscale (OMMS) data sources to identify harmful algal blooms.
